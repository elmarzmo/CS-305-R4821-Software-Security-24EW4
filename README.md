Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a client seeking to enhance the security of their financial software applications.
They requested our assistance in addressing vulnerabilities in their software, particularly focusing on implementing secure coding practices and
ensuring compliance with industry standards to protect sensitive financial data and mitigate potential cyber threats.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

When identifying our client's software security vulnerabilities, we analysis and precise remediation, ensuring all potential risks were addressed effectively.
Secure coding is paramount as it establishes robust defenses against cyber threats, safeguarding sensitive data and preserving trust in the integrity of the software. 
By prioritizing software security, companies can prevent costly data breaches, maintain regulatory compliance, and safeguard their reputation.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part to me was ensuring the successful conversion of HTTP to HTTPS protocol during the Secure Communications step.
This involved carefully modifying the application.properties file to enable HTTPS configuration, including specifying the correct keystore and password.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security, I implemented several measures such as enabling HTTPS protocol, using secure hashing algorithms like SHA-256,
and conducting regular dependency checks to identify and address any vulnerabilities. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After refactoring the code, I conducted functional testing to ensure the application performed correctly and security testing using OWASP Dependency-Check Maven to identify any new vulnerabilities.
Regular code reviews were also essential to maintain security.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The tools and practices I found helpful included OWASP Dependency-Check Maven for vulnerability assessment, keytool for managing keystores and certificates,
and secure coding practices such as using HTTPS protocol and hashing sensitive data.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I could present evidence of my ability to implement secure coding practices, conduct vulnerability assessments, and mitigate potential risks. 
I would showcase the refactored code with HTTPS protocol implementation, hash algorithms for data security, and secure REST endpoints.
I could provide reports from the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven tool, and any other relevant documentation that demonstrates my skills and experience in ensuring software security.
